/**
 * The body of every error the API answers with, in the shape of RFC 9457 problem details: a short
 * {@code title} that is the same for every problem of its kind, the HTTP {@code status}, and a
 * {@code detail} saying what went wrong with this request. A request that failed validation also
 * lists its {@code violations}, one per invalid value; an unexpected failure carries the
 * {@code errorId} it was logged under, and nothing of its internals.
 * <p>
 * The errors used to be plain text in several shapes - a sentence from the resource, or the
 * message of whatever exception got out, Hibernate's included - so a client could only show them,
 * not read them.
